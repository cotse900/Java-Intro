I started off doing the basics in Java in this exercise. Java essentially enforces class. Using IntelliJ, I came to know how Java has elaborate file structure as I see in an IDE. Java's basics also show clearly how things like methods and "static" are important for even simple programs. These are similar to what I learned in C++ before. It is a pleasant experience writing Java when many things are streamlined. For instance, there is the way to refactor (renaming files) without having to set up everything again like in C.

Similarly, while Java is strong-typed like C, it is powerful for offering many features like, for instance, hasNextInt, the byte data type, and the use of "new" for initializing class objects. I am quite sure students caxn learn coding from Java first, but it's simply a breeze when I came across C before, just to see Java as an obligatory OOP language.
