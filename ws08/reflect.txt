This workshop is rather short and only on lambda expressions. I was already using lambda in workshop 6 and workshop 7.

Applying the double[] array in the interface, we determin the maximum value, minimum value, sum of array elements, and the average value, all as doubles.

The counter function returns a double value, but for my presentation purpose, I cast it into integer.

The main focus is on the lambda:

    public static final DoubleArrayFunctions MaxVal = array -> {
        double max = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
        for (double d : array) {
            if (d > max) {
                max = d;
            }
        }
        return max;
    };

For all 4 required functions plus counter, it is possible to use a lambda for succinct code.
